## Setup SSH Key-Based Authentication

### What and Why

[What is SSH Public Key Authentication?](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication)

>The motivation for using public key authentication over simple passwords is security. Public key authentication provides cryptographic strength that even extremely long passwords can not offer. With [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/), public key authentication improves security considerably as it frees the users from remembering complicated passwords (or worse yet, writing them down).
>
>In addition to security public key authentication also offers usability benefits - it allows users to implement single sign-on across the [SSH servers](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/server) they connect to. Public key authentication also allows automated, passwordless login that is a key enabler for the countless secure automation processes that execute within enterprise networks globally.

### Terms

- **OpenSSH**: OpenSSH is a connectivity tool for remote sign-in that uses the SSH protocol. It encrypts all traffic between client and server to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.
- **SSH Target**: SSH server, the Linux you want to log in.
- **`ssh-keygen`**: a standard component of the [Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (SSH) protocol suite. The ssh-keygen utility is used to generate, manage, and convert authentication keys.
- **SSH config file**: OpenSSH client-side configuration file is named `config`, and it is stored in the `.ssh` directory under the userâ€™s home directory.
- **`ssh` command/client**: OpenSSH remote login client.
- **`.ssh` folder**: `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\` on Windows, `~/.ssh/` on Linux and macOS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are generating ssh keys in Windows, the following demo code works in Command Prompt instead of PowerShell.


1. Verify that you can use username and password to connect to the SSH target.
   ```shell
   ssh USERNAME_OF_SSH_TARGET@FQDN_OR_IP_ADDR_OF_SSH_TARGET
   ```

   ![verify-username-pwd-log-in](./Setup%20SSH%20Key-Based%20Authentication.assets/verify-username-pwd-log-in.jpeg) 

2. Generate an ed25519 key pair and save it to client's `.ssh` folder. If the folder does not exist, create it. `- C` specifies the comment.

   ```cmd
   : On Microsoft Windows
   mkdir "%USERPROFILE%/.ssh"
   cd "%USERPROFILE%/.ssh"
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "%USERPROFILE%/.ssh/YOUR_KEY_NAME" -C "John Doe"
   
   : If your Windows does not take forward slash, try backward slash
   mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh"
   cd "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh"
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\YOUR_KEY_NAME" -C "John Doe"
   ```

   ```shell
   # On Linux or macOS
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   cd ~/.ssh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "~/.ssh/YOUR_KEY_NAME" -C "John Doe"
   ```

   The screenshot below shows using `ssh-keygen` to generate a key pair (`devops_vm_id.pub` and `devops_vm_id`).
   ![ssh-keygen-demo](./Setup%20SSH%20Key-Based%20Authentication.assets/ssh-keygen-demo.jpeg) 

3. Copy the content of public key generated (the file with `.pub` filename extention) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the SSH target. If the `~/.ssh/` directory does not exist on the SSH target, create it.

   Display the public key on the client:

   ```cmd
   : On Microsoft Windows
   type "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\YOUR_KEY_NAME.pub"
   ```

   ```shell
   # On Linux or macOS
   cat ~/.ssh/YOUR_KEY_NAME.pub
   ```

   The following demo shows copying the content of public key `devops_vm_id` to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the SSH target at `192.168.47.143`. The username of the SSH target is `student`.
   ```cmd
   ssh student@192.168.47.143 mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   ssh student@192.168.47.143 "echo 'CONTENT_YOUR_PUB_KEY' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

   ![ssh-copy-pub-id](./Setup%20SSH%20Key-Based%20Authentication.assets/ssh-copy-pub-id.jpeg) 
   **Note**: You can use `ssh-copy-id` command on Linux client. [What is ssh-copy-id? How ssh-copy-id works?](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id)

4. `ssh` into the SSH target using key-based authentication using `-i` argument followed by the location of the private key file. If you can connect to the SSH target **without typing password**, you made it!

   ```cmd
   : On Microsoft Windows
   ssh -i "%USERPROFILE%/.ssh/YOUR_KEY_NAME" USERNAME@FQDN_OR_IP_ADDR_OF_SSH_TARGET
   
   : If your Windows does not take forward slash, try backward slash
   ssh -i "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\YOUR_KEY_NAME" USERNAME@FQDN_OR_IP_ADDR_OF_SSH_TARGET
   
   : If your Windows still complains about file not found
   cd "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\"
   ssh -i YOUR_KEY_NAME USERNAME@FQDN_OR_IP_ADDR_OF_SSH_TARGET
   ```

   ```shell
   # On Linux or macOS
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/YOUR_KEY_NAME USERNAME@FQDN_OR_IP_ADDR_OF_SSH_TARGET
   ```

5. OpenSSH allows you to set up a per-user configuration file where you can store different SSH options for each remote machine you connect to. Edit the SSH config file on your OpenSSH **client**.
   
   If you don't have `"%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config"` file on Microsoft Windows or `~/.ssh/config` file on Linux or macOS, create one. **If the SSH config already exists, append** the Host section for the SSH target to the config file.

   When creating the `config` file, make sure to save it as `config` without the `.txt` extension. Some text editors may automatically append `.txt` to the filename, so **double-check the file name before saving**.
   ![save-as](./Setup%20SSH%20Key-Based%20Authentication.assets/save-as.webp)
   
   If you already saved the `config` file as `config.txt`, in your Command Prompt, rename it by running 
   
   ```shell
   ren "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config.txt" "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config"
   ```
   
   [SSH config file syntax and how-tos for configuring the OpenSSH client](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config)
   
   ```
   # Append the following section to your SSH config file on SSH client.
   # You can "/" on Windows as path delimiter.
   # StrictHostKeyChecking and UserKnownHostsFile are recommended.
   Host NAME_FOR_SSH_TARGET
     HostName                FQDN_OR_IP_OF_SSH_TARGET
     User                    USERNAME_OF_SSH_TARGET
     IdentityFile            ~/.ssh/PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME
     ServerAliveInterval     5
     ExitOnForwardFailure    yes
     StrictHostKeyChecking   no
     UserKnownHostsFile      /dev/null
   ```
   
   The screenshot below shows a `Host` section with name `devops-vm`.
   
   ![ssh-config-file](./Setup%20SSH%20Key-Based%20Authentication.assets/ssh-config-file.png)  
   
6. `ssh` into the SSH target using SSH configuration defined in SSH config file.

   ```shell
   ssh NAME_OF_HOST_SECTION
   ```

   **Note**: Use name of `Host` section (`devops-vm` in the screenshot below) instead of `HostName` (`192.168.47.143` in the screenshot below) of Host section.

   If you can connect to the SSH target **without typing password**, congratulations!
